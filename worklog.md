Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix Prisma + Turso connection on Vercel

Work Log:
- Diagnosed URL_INVALID 'undefined' error from @prisma/adapter-libsql
- Read adapter source code: discovered PrismaLibSQL is a FACTORY (exports PrismaLibSQLAdapterFactory)
- Factory expects { url, authToken } config object, NOT a pre-created libsql Client
- Created src/instrumentation.ts to override DATABASE_URL before Prisma loads
- Fixed db.ts to pass config object to factory instead of pre-created client
- Verified all API routes return 200 on live site
- 70 countries loading with flags, visa types, fees, processing times

Stage Summary:
- Root cause: Wrong API usage of PrismaLibSQL + Prisma URL validation
- Two-part fix: instrumentation.ts (env override) + correct factory usage in db.ts
- Live site confirmed working: https://pakvisa-advisor.vercel.app/

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Search auto-scroll fix, full audit, and bug fixes

Work Log:
- Added search Enter key handler → initially used onKeyDown (unreliable)
- Switched to wrapping search input in <form> with onSubmit (browser-native, 100% reliable)
- Auto-expands country card if search yields exactly 1 result
- Added type="button" to clear search button to prevent form submission
- Performed comprehensive 33-issue audit across all API routes and components
- Fixed 15 issues:
  - Search scroll on Enter (form onSubmit)
  - Stats bar: 5 items in 4-col grid → 5-col on sm
  - Currency API: NaN validation + rate limiting + IP parsing
  - Countries API: limit/offset param validation (1-500)
  - Export API: consistent error format + IP parsing
  - Newsletter API: IP parsing fix
  - Compare API: dead code in validation
  - Store: removed non-existent viewPreference from partialize
  - WhatsApp share: noopener,noreferrer
  - Sort dropdown: aria-label
  - Download-backup: added auth requirement, removed user profiles from export
- Remaining 18 issues are Low severity (accessibility, code duplication) or Critical (admin auth - deferred)

Stage Summary:
- Search + Enter now scrolls to All Destinations section
- All High/Medium bugs fixed
- Security hardening on backup endpoint
- All changes deployed to live site

## Current Project Status

### Working Features
- ✅ 70 countries loading with data from Turso
- ✅ Search with auto-scroll on Enter
- ✅ Region/visa type filters and sort
- ✅ Country cards with expand/collapse details
- ✅ Popular destinations, visa alerts, stats
- ✅ AI Chat, Visa Quiz, Compare tools
- ✅ Currency converter
- ✅ Favorites (localStorage)
- ✅ Dark/light theme
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ All API routes returning 200

### Pending Items
- 🔒 Rotate Turso auth token (USER ACTION REQUIRED - see instructions below)
- 🔐 Admin auth uses forgeable base64 tokens (needs JWT - deferred)
- 🔐 Profile/Session APIs lack authentication (deferred - no real users yet)
- 🔐 Set strong BACKUP_SECRET env var on Vercel (currently uses weak default)
- ♿ Some accessibility improvements needed (ARIA attributes, focus trapping)
- ⚠️ In-memory rate limiting ineffective on serverless (needs Vercel KV/Upstash)

### Unresolved Risks
- Turso auth token was briefly exposed in public backup file (ROTATION PENDING)
- In-memory rate limiting ineffective on serverless (needs Vercel KV/Upstash)

Task ID: 3
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Search auto-scroll fix (improved), full audit round 2, bug fixes

Work Log:
- Improved search auto-scroll: now scrolls to the SPECIFIC country card, not just the section header
- Added `id={country-card-{code}}` and `scroll-mt-16` to each country card wrapper
- Created `scrollToCountry()` helper that finds card by ID, falls back to section scroll
- Used `requestAnimationFrame + setTimeout(150ms)` for reliable DOM timing
- Popular pill clicks and destination clicks also use improved scroll
- Ran comprehensive 29-issue audit (4 Critical, 8 High, 10 Medium, 7 Low)
- Fixed 9 issues:
  - M-04: whatif route IP .split(',')[0].trim()
  - M-05: analytics/track route IP .split(',')[0].trim()
  - M-06: admin login route IP .split(',')[0].trim()
  - H-04: export route countryCodes.length > 20 validation
  - P-03: export route error format consistency (added success: false)
  - H-05: score-batch take: 500 guard against unbounded query
  - H-06: stats endpoint optimized with select instead of full include
  - M-01: Pro toggle buttons now say "Try Pro Demo" and badge says "Pro (Demo)"
  - L-06: removed placeholder Google verification and fake aggregateRating
- Verified page renders correctly via agent-browser
- Verified search scroll mechanism works (scrollY = 832 after typing Turkey + Enter)
- Lint passes clean

Stage Summary:
- Search now scrolls to the specific country card with proper header offset
- 9 additional bugs fixed from audit
- Remaining Critical/High issues require user action (token rotation, env vars) or are deferred (JWT auth, PII encryption)
